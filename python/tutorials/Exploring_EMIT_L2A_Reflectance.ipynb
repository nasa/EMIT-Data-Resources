    "# Exploring L2A Reflectance\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary**  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will open a Level 2A (L2A) Reflectance product file (netcdf) from Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation (EMIT). We will inspect the structure and plot the spectra of individual pixels and spatial coverage of a single band. Next, we will orthorectify the imagery using the included geometry lookup table (GLT). Finally, we will take advantage of the `holoviews streams` module to build an interactive plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Background**\n",
    "\n",
    "The EMIT instrument is an imaging spectrometer that measures light in visible and infrared wavelengths. These measurements display unique spectral signatures that correspond to the composition on the Earth's surface. The EMIT mission focuses specifically on mapping the composition of minerals to better understand the effects of mineral dust throughout the Earth system and human populations now and in the future. More details about EMIT and its associated products can be found in the **README.md** and on the [EMIT website](https://earth.jpl.nasa.gov/emit/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The L2A Reflectance Product contains estimated surface reflectance. Surface reflectance is the fraction of incoming solar radiation reflected Earth's surface. Materials reflect proportions of radiation differently based upon their chemical composition.  This means that reflectance information can be used to determine the composition of a target. In this guide you will learn how to plot a band from the L2A reflectance spatially and look at the spectral curve associated with individual pixels.\n",
